never-before-seen material and interviews with the couple's most intimate family and friends including Ronald Reagan Jr., THE REAGANS explores the indelible mark the Reagans left on society, the

By shining a light on the truths behind the Reagan myth and critically analyzing Ronald Reagan's quest for power, his mode of governing, the ripple effects of his economic policies and the unprecedented role Nancy Reagan played in the White House, the series redefines the Reagans a generation after they stood at the center of the national and global stage. Covering Reagan's rise from movie star to politician and tackling his questionable record on race, the administration's near collapse amid the Iran-Contra scandal, and inaction in the face of the HIV pandemic, THE REAGANS offers an epochal look at a recent past that has much to do with our turbulent present.\",\"heroImage\":{\"id\":\"n-2606322\",\"type\":\"Image\",\"thumborId\":\"v1.bjsyNjA2MzIyO2o7MTg3MDU7MTIwMDsxMjAwOzgzNA\",\"height\":834,\"width\":1200,\"format\":\"JPG\",\"caption\":null,\"lastUpdateDate\":\"2020-10-22\"},\"title\":\"The Reagans\",\"posterImage\":{\"id\":\"t-774751\",\"type\":\"Image\",\"thumborId\":\"v1.dDs3NzQ3NTE7ajsxODYzODsxMjAwOzgwMDsxMjAw\",\"height\":1200,\"width\":800,\"format\":\"JPG\",\"caption\":null,\"lastUpdateDate\":\"2020-10-22\"},\"endYear\":0,\"network\":\"Showtime\",\"premiereDate\":\"2020-11-14T16:00:00-08:00\",\"isEmbargoed\":false,\"vanityUrl\":\"the_reagans\",\"mainTrailer\":null,\"genre\":\"Documentary\",\"franchiseId\":null,\"tvSeasons\":null},\"tvPagePhotosUrl\":\"\\u002Ftv\\u002Fthe_reagans\\u002Fs01\\u002Fpictures\",\"tvPageUrl\":\"\\u002Ftv\\u002Fthe_reagans\\u002Fs01\",\"tvPageReviewsUrl\":\"\\u002Ftv\\u002Fthe_reagans\\u002Fs01\\u002Freviews\",\"tvPageVideosUrl\":\"\\u002Ftv\\u002Fthe_reagans\\u002Fs01\\u002Fvideos\",\"unformattedStartDate\":\"2020-11-14T16:00:00-08:00\",\"urlItem\":\"\\u002Ftv\\u002Fthe_reagans\\u002Fs01\",\"vanityUrl\":\"\\u002Fthe_reagans\\u002Fs01\",\"videoClipsMeta\":null,\"sortKey\":\"4\"},{\"id\":\"46358\",\"seriesVanity\":\"fargo\",\"parsedVanity\":{\"seriesVanity\":\"fargo\",\"seasonId\":\"s04\"},\"seasonId\":\"s04\",\"title\":\"Season 4\",\"description\":\"In 1950 Kansas City, two criminal syndicates jockey to control an alternate economy of exploitation, graft and drugs while fighting for a piece of the American dream.
